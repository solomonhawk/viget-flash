# viget-flash

A flash card game for Viget employees!

### Roadmap

**Peyton Crump**:
> One thing would be to only have guys' names answers come up for the guys and ladies' names answers for the ladies

**Ben Eckerson**:
> Make a tougher level that completely pixelates the images or (decapitates folks in the spirit of halloween?) for those people like Crump who have been here forever.

**Kahnh Stenberg**:
> Use facejuggler.com BOOM. more difficult and terrifying.

**Brian Williams**:
> What if you randomly mix up the first and last names? "Saad Williams" and "Emily Lewis" and "Elliott Shifflett" for example

**Anjali Merchant**:
> You could have a second question about what office the person is in. Or, use the top filters for office locations and have the second question be what team they are a part of. Must answer both correctly.

**Eli Fatsi**:
> Make the *'s either a consistent length or a random length. I think now the number of *'s before you guess is the number of letters and spaces in the persons name - kind of gives it away

**Elliot Munez**:
> Not "harder" necessarily, but have the form submit when a name is selected (versus having to explicitly click "submit"). It makes each selection more of a commitment.
